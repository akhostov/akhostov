- 👋 Hi, I’m Ali Ahmad Khostovan and I am an astrophysicist currently working at University of Kentucky as a Scientist II/postdoctoral researcher.
- 👀 I’m interested in emission line galaxies and how we can use them to understand star formation activity at varying cosmic times.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning large-scale data reduction techniques using various telescopes as part of an archival spectroscopic survey.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to understanding star formation activity on an extragalactic scale from the low-z to high-z Universe. Check out my NASA ADS for some background of what I work on.
